	<p><strong>inline-block</strong> is a friendly Slack-powered community consisting of frontend and backend developers, UX and UI designers, digital marketers, and more.</p>
	<p>While many online communities are focused around specific roles or tools, what makes <strong>inline-block</strong> unique is the diverse mix of experience and skills. It's a great place to learn from others and ask questions or to share your work and get feedback.</p>
	<p>There's plenty of web talk, of course. We love code and design. But there's also channels for books, business and freelancing, productivity, routines &amp; habits, photography, and more.</p>
	<p>We're a friendly, welcoming group. Whether you're a freelancer, agency owner, or in a full-time position, we think you'll get a lot from our community.</p>
